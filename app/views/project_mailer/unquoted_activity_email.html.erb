  <p>Hi</p>

  <p>New activity <%= @task.name %> has been added to <%= link_to @task.project.name, project_url(@task.project, subdomain: @task.project.account.site_address)%> that has not been quoted for.</p>

  <p>You have received this email because you are either the project manager for the project or you have been selected to receive all budget emails (you may remove your email address from your FleetSuite settings).

  <p>Thanks,<br/>
