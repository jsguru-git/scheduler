                <h2 class="blue_med_oswald_text">Invoices</h2>
                <p>Creating and sending invoices has been designed to be as flexible as possible. You can choose to manage your invoices based on an existing payment profile, generate them based on actual tracked time, or simply add a new item to cover any unexpected costs. PDF invoices are generated that can be sent to your clients along with the ability to mark invoices as sent or paid to help keep track of your cash flow.</p>

                <h2 class="blue_med_oswald_text">Unified</h2>
                <p>Integrating seamlessly with both the schedule and track tools, the invoice tool can instantly bring existing data across to save you time and money. Payment profiles can be based on your team schedule and rate card to predict cost. Invoices can be generated based on a projects tracked time, making sure you invoice for all time, which has been spent on that project.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="pos_3">
                <h2 class="blue_med_oswald_text">Payment profiles</h2>
                <p>
                    Generating payment profiles for your project could not be quicker. Either choose to create each payment stage manually by entering a name and cost or automatically generate the cost based on time and your daily rate per service.
